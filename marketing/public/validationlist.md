## London Borough of Sutton Local Validation List

In addition to the National requirements, the Local Validation List clarifies the additional information required to accompany a planning application so that it can be validated. This will then enable the Local Planning Authority (Development Management) to begin its determination of the planning application. The scope and degree of the information required will vary for each application. The London Borough of Sutton asks that you submit applications electronically using the Planning Portal.

Developers and applicants are encouraged to engage in pre-application discussions with the Council before an application is made through the pre-application advice service. The pre-application advice service will assist in tailoring the list of requirements that apply to your development. Please read the Local Validation List carefully before submitting a planning application and please note that not all the information itemized in the local list will be required for every application. This document is divided into four parts as follows:

### Part 1

This is a quick guide for the most common types of applications;

### Part 2

The application types guide will provide details of when specific documents are required based on the proposed scheme.

- Advertisement
- Change of Use
- Householder
- Lawful Development Certificate
- Major (9+ dwellings or 999+sqm floorspace)
- Minor (1-9 dwellings or up to 999sqm of floorspace)

### Part 3

The document guide will detail what is expected for each requirement and offer further help and guidance.

### Part 4

A guide for all other types of application

- Details Reserved by Condition
- Listed Building Consent
- Minor Material Amendment (S73)
- Non-Material Amendment
- Permission in Principle
- Prior Approval
- Works to Protected Trees

If the relevant information contained within the Local List is not provided with your submission, the processing of your application will be delayed and the application will be made invalid.

Please note that if your application is found to be invalid on submission, an additional administration fee will be charged and you will be given 28 days in which to make the required changes to the application and pay the administration charge. Failure to either make the required changes to the application, or to pay the administration charge could result in your application being withdrawn.

## Supporting Documents

Acoustic and Vibration - Impact Assessment

An Impact Assessment will likely be required where there is significant noise use such as food/ drink/ entertainment and leisure uses, industrial uses, day nurseries, places of worship, schools and colleges. An Impact Assessment will also likely be required where a proposal generates a significant amount of traffic and EIA development. Vibration impacts will likely have to be considered on certain types of applications such as those adjacent to railway lines or busy roads and where there are vibration sensitive uses. The Impact Assessment should be carried out by a qualified person and include, among other matters, an assessment of the existing background noise/vibration level over a 24 hour period, predicted noise levels, predicted vibration levels and identification of any mitigation required. The assessment should demonstrate compliance and make reference to relevant British Standards.

All submitted documents should be in PDF format (including photographs). Applications will be made invalid for incorrectly formatted plans/documents.

In addition, for applications for new developments where A3/A4 late night premises are structurally attached or in close proximity to proposed residential properties and live or recorded music (other than background) is likely to form part of the proposed use the applicant should submit an acoustic and vibration report as part of their application. This would apply to applications where new residential properties are being introduced above, adjacent or in close proximity to existing A3/A4/late night premises that currently provide live or recorded music. The report shall demonstrate a sound insulation scheme that ensures that a (1) typical maximum noise levels of the music in each octave band from 63Hz to 4kHz will be no higher than the pre-existing L90 noise level (music off) as measured or calculated in the residential dwelling and (2) there should be no increase in the L90 (music playing) over the background L90 (music off) in any 1/3 octave band between 40Hz-160Hz.

Prior to the commencement of development further information should be sought from the Environmental health team through the pre-application process.

|Ecological Assessment/Biodiversity Net Gain Assessment|As part of the Council’s commitment to conserving and promoting wildlife through the Biodiversity Strategy 2020-2025, all planning applications must have consideration to local biodiversity. A suitable ecological appraisal (usually, an EcIA) is required for sites that are likely to have a negative impact on wildlife and habitats. All surveys and impact assessments should be carried out in accordance with Sutton Council’s Validation Information: Biodiversity. This includes smaller works, such as roof or loft changes, which may affect bat roosts, which will require at least a Preliminary Roost Assessment (PRA). Building a Sustainable Future - Technical Guidance Note Government guidance - Protected species Biodiversity Strategy 2020-2025. All major applications will undertake a Biodiversity Net Gain assessment using the Council’s adopted calculator and Building a Sustainable Sutton - Technical Guidance Note ‘Biodiversity Accounting’, with smaller applications undertaking BNG assessments if removing greater than 100m2 of natural habitat or vegetation. NOTE: From the end of November 2023, in line with the national mandate for Biodiversity Net Gain, the way Biodiversity Net Gain Assessments are to be undertaken within Sutton is likely to change. Developers and their agents will need to seek advice on the Council’s position at this time. Biodiversity Net Gain Assessments should incorporate mainly native landscaping and Green Infrastructure, which will integrate with the Building a Sustainable Sutton - Technical Guidance Note ‘Green Space Factor’ to provide multi-functional benefits. Sutton requires developments to provide additional features for wildlife, including swift bricks, bat roosts etc. (please see Biodiversity Strategy 2020-2025 for more information).

- Demonstrate that the 1 in 30 year rainfall event (plus climate change) can be contained without flooding and that any flooding occurring between the 1 in 30 and 1 in 100 year event (plus climate change) will be safely contained on site.
- Provide details of the implementation timetable together with a management and maintenance plan including arrangements for adoption where relevant.
- Designs should be multifunctional to include water quality, amenity, and biodiversity benefits.

### Tree survey, Arboricultural Impact Assessment (AIA) and Arboricultural Method Statement (AMS)

The tree survey is an appraisal and assessment of tree quality. The arboricultural impact assessment (AIA) is required to clearly identify impacts to trees and provide solutions to minimise or mitigate for these and must include a tree retention/removal plan. The tree survey and AIA must comply with BS5837:2012 Trees in Relation to Design, Demolition and Construction. If the impacts identified in the AIA require tree protection or special working methods, an arboricultural method statement (AMS) and tree protection plan to BS5837:2012 is also required. The tree survey, AMS and AIA should be undertaken by a qualified arboriculturist.

### Waste Management, Storage and Collection Strategy

There is a requirement to make appropriate arrangements and/or space for the storage and collection of recycling and refuse on site. These details will need to be included on the plans with a collection and management strategy. Reducing carbon and emissions should also be at the forefront of your thinking when devising such a strategy.
